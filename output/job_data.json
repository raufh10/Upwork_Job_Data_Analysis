The three software that we use are HubSpot, Real Green & Quickbooks so that would be where the data is pulled from.

I have code that calculates a fair price for each car based on multiple variables and compares that fair price to the actual price of the car. Each car is ranked on the price differentiation. We are trying to find pricing arbitrage opportunities where cars are listed at prices below their fair market value so we can buy them and resell them through our dealership. Previously I used a pivot table to sort the data and filter for types of cars I wanted etc. I want to come up with a better way to visualise the data. I want to be able to have an excel or power bi model that I can dro the fresh data into each morning and look at the results in a consistent way. The data should be well laid out and it should eb easy to spot real opportunities. I have attached a file example of the data I receive each day on excel.",

This dashboard tracks and displays call and sales logs made by our life coaching team. The underlying data for this dashboard is stored in a MySQL database. The primary objective is to enhance the data retrieval speed and overall display efficiency. Project Background: My current hypothesis is that Looker might be fetching all available data and applying filters at the front end, causing delays. To streamline this, I'm considering implementing custom SQL queries with parameterized date ranges to filter the data at the database level, thereby pulling only the essential data. Key Responsibilities: Evaluate my optimization strategy and provide feedback. Is the assumption about Looker's data retrieval process accurate? Would this strategy indeed expedite the data fetching process? Thoroughly analyze the existing dashboard setup, paying close attention to filters, merges, and other configurations. Develop optimized queries that minimize data fetching time. Transition the dashboard to utilize the newly crafted queries as its data source. Requirements: Proven experience with Looker Studio, specifically in dashboard optimization. Strong proficiency in SQL, especially in crafting efficient queries. Familiarity with MySQL databases. Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills. Effective communication abilities to provide insights, recommendations, and clarifications. Project Timeline: I am keen on initiating this project promptly and would appreciate a quick turnaround. Please outline your availability and an estimated completion timeframe in your proposal. In your application, do share relevant Looker Studio projects you've executed, especially any optimizations you've undertaken. Any insights or suggestions you might have about the project right off the bat will also be valued. Looking forward to collaborating with a skilled Looker Studio professional!",

Most reports are connected using SSAS tabular models, others are connected via SQL databases, sharepoint data sources, etc. One of our most important reports which provides management daily insights has been slow to load and often even times out. We have optimised this report, but it is still loading slow and the interactive features don\u2019t always work. The report sometimes loads quick, other times loading can take 30 minutes or even more. The report that was loading within seconds and was able be used dynamically by our users. However, the report started loading slowly about 2.5 months ago without a clear reason or changes we made to the report/server. We are aware of the following optimisations that can be applied to speed up PBI loading (in progress): - Update OS to a more recent version - Update SSAS to a more recent version - Create an optimised tabular model data source (eg apply indexes, fact/dimension table structure) - Remove columns/data points within the tabular model that are not required - Archive data (older than 2 years) However, these were not in place 2.5 months ago either, hence they don\u2019t explain the recent increase in time this specific report required to load. First part of the objective is to resolve the slow loading of this key report. This will be followed by providing more general recommendation and suggestions to improve our PowerBI set-up.

I know what is pandas, seaborn etc. But I don't use them as my job is not related to data analysis. One example of a data analysis on the dataset is Property was bought by person A in 2000. Person A sold it to person B in 2005. I want to calculate the profit between year 2000 and 2005. Person B then sold it to person C in 2020. I want to calculate the profit. The property can be identified by the address, which is repeated in the datasets. The whole dataset is 500k rows. Too many to use excel. I don't know how to write the code to extract the profit from these transactions or do the analysis. Another example is to calculate where the profit is highest. Is it in region A, B or C? Another example is to calculate whether the profit is high if some bought in 2008 (when prices were low during global financial crisis), or 2010 (when prices became very high after the global financial crisis). Conversely, see which properties lost money when they were transacted. Also do other basic descriptive and exploratory data analysis. Dataset is in csv. Need someone to start from scratch. Load the data into colab, write the code, produce the visualizations. I will think of more things to explore in the dataset as we go along. Separately, you need to be patient as I may want to learn the basics of the code. There is no extreme regression or machine learning or AI or neural network needed for this project. But if you have ideas to use the dataset in interesting ways I am happy to hear it. For example, doing hedonic regression which is commonly used in the property industry to produce automated valuations. Or combine the property transaction data with map or spatial data like amenities, transport, shopping malls, school etc. nearby to do plotting. Examples of columns in the dataset are property name, address, region, district, price of sale, year of sale, purchaser background. There are a few others. I am at GMT+8 We will chat on upwork and use the zoom function here if we have video calls. I will send a copy of the dataset to those shortlisted.",
